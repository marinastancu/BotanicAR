# BotanicAR
An experimental, cross-platform AR mobile application for Android and iOS made using C# with Unity.

Originally made in 2022, it is being refurbished to be presented at STRP Festival 2023.

The application imagines a digital futuristic botanical garden. Developed during STRP Spacemakers 2022 originally, for the following research question:

>Multinational corporations are constantly logging, tracking, scanning and digitising our world around us.

>Imagine in the near future every physical space is connected to the digital realm. Augmented reality has become a part of our daily lives. 

>A digital skin is projected over buildings, public spaces and even in our own homes. Virtual reality and reality have merged to become our everyday reality.
